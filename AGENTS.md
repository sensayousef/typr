# AGENTS.md

Cross-tool instructions for any AI coding assistant working in this repo.

For the full project rules, session start, sprint workflow, folder ownership, code rules, and testing protocol, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Everything in `CLAUDE.md` applies to every assistant, not just Claude.

## Read Aloud Report

End every coding-assistant response that completes meaningful repository work, and every development session wrap-up, with a final section headed exactly `## 🔊 Read Aloud`. The user consumes this through a text-to-speech tool, so it must be written for the ear:

- Plain spoken prose only. No bullets, no markdown symbols, no code blocks, no backticks, no emoji inside the spoken text, no raw file paths.
- Spell things out for speech: say "the App dot tsx file" not `App.tsx`, "sprint seven" not `sprint-07`.
- Cumulative and self-contained: cover what was asked, what changed and why, what was verified, and what's still open.
- Place it last, after all other output. If a response did no real work, the section may be skipped.
